# Data

This section covers steps from raw data collection (i.e. sending images of receipts to a data store), annotating the receipts (i.e. selecting the text tokens for every label), and pre-processing the receipt images.

# Training

This section covers the steps after the data collection. Given the data and a base model, a new model is trained and saved for inference.

# Inference

This section assumes a trained model to be available. This section covers the steps to deploy the model either as a shared model or a customer-specific model, ready to be used for inference.
